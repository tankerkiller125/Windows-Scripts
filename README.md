# Windows Scripts

These scripts are just some things I've created while at work to manage both servers and clients. Most of these are buggy and or require some knowlege to use properly. Documentation needs to be written for these scripts as my knowlege of powershell progresses.

## Some Notes on Licensing

This project is licensed under AGPLv3.0 which means that using these scripts on the network is distribution. This is on purpose so that anyone who wants to find and use these scripts can do so. Please consider donating any changed you make to these scripts back to the original project if they would benifit other people.
